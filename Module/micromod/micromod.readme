A good-quality player library for the ProTracker MOD music format.

Also included is a powerful command-line tool for the creation of
MOD files from textual MT files and WAV samples. There is some basic
documentation built-in to the tool and the JAR file includes some
simple example MT files. Some knowledge of the ProTracker MOD format,
audio synthesis and "tracking" is assumed.

To invoke the tool use the command-line "java -jar micromod.jar".

Cheers,
