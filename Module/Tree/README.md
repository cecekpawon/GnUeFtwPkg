# tree

The GNU [tree](https://linux.die.net/man/1/tree) utility prints out a directory structure in a tree-like display using utf-8 characters. I've been using it as something to build when learning a new programming language. This repository contains all of the implementations that I have done in various languages. To execute, run `make [language]` where language is one of:

* c
* elixir
* go
* java
* javascript
* php
* python
* ruby
* rust
* scala
* shell

Note that this does not include information on getting the necessary utilities installed, so you may not be able to run every one of them depending on your setup.
